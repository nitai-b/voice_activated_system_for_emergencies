# Introduction:
The Voice Activated System for Emergencies is one in which calls for assistance are made through the intuitive process of human speech. This system utilizes a voice recognition module, a GSM module and a PIC microprocessor to achieve its functionality. The intention is to provide a means of assistance to persons with disabilities.

This is a version of my final year project at UWI. Degree: BSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering
Back then I used an old school style of version control. But these are my files for my basic design. If you need more documentation, I would be happy to provide it.
