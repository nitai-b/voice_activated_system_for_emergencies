////  This program demonstrates the use of malloc() to allocate a     ////
////  block of memory. The user can add or delete words from a        ////
////  list, or show the lists contents. When the user instructs       ////
////  the program to add a new word, malloc() is used to allocate     ////
////  memory for a new cell. free() is used to deallocate the         ////
////  memory when the user instructs to delete a cell. When the user  ////
////  wants to know the contents of the list, the contents of each    ////
////  cell is displayed. A pointer to the next cell is also stored    ////
////  in a cell. This is used to cycle through the list.              ////
////                                                                  ////
////  Jumpers:                                                        ////
////     PCM,PCH    pin C7 to RS232 RX, pin C6 to RS232 TX            ////

////  This example will work with the PCM and PCH compilers.  The     ////
////  following conditional compilation lines are used to include a   ////
