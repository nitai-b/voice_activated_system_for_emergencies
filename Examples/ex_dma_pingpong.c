////  This program reads 100 A/D samples captured from channel       ////
////  AN8 and stores them in DMA RAM. The next set of 1000 samples   ////
////  that are read are  transfered to a seperate data buffer.       ////
////  The DMA is setup in Ping Pong mode in which it will alternate  ////
////  between two buffers to fill in data read from the ADC channel  ////
////  The user can process data in buffer 1 while the second buffer  ////
////  is getting filled up. The second buffer can then be processed  ////
////  as the first gets filled up.                                   ////

////  The code is setup to read data from ADC channel 8. A timer     ////
////  interrupt is called every 1 ms which triggers a conversion.    ////
////  At the end of every conversion, the DMA transfer takes place   ////
////  The DMA count register is set to 100 using the dma_start()     ////
////  function call which uses the sizeof buffer to set the count    ////
////  When 'count' number of conversions and transfers are complete  ////
////  the DMA interrupt gets triggered. The user can toggle between  ////
////  these two buffers by toggling the
