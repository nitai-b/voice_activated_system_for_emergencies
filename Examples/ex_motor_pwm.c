////  This program will show how to use the built in MOTOR PWM       ////
////  functions available on dsPIC33FJxxxMCxxx PICs.  This program   ////
////  sets up four PWM pairs for a total of 8 PWM outputs. PWM pairs ////
////  1, 2, 3 are setup to operate in complementary mode, and PWM    ////
////  pair 4 is setup to operate in independent mode.                ////
////                                                                 ////
////  PWM pair 1's duty cycle is setup to be adjustable by using the ////
////  analog reading of AN0 to set the duty. PWM pair 2, 3, and 4    ////
////  duty cycle is set to a fixed 25%, 50%, and 75%.                ////
////                                                                 ////
////  PWM pair 1 and 4 have an active and inactive dead-time set to  ////
////  100 instructions, 10 us with a 20 MHz input clock.  PWM pair 2 ////
////  and 4 have an active and inactive dead-time set to 30          ////
////  instructions, 3 us with a 20 MHz input clock.                  ////
////                                                                 ////
////  PWM pair 1 also has fault A enabled to cause the 1L to go low  ////
////  and 1H to go high if a fault occurs, line goes low, on Fault   ////
////  A, PIN_D8 on the dsPIC33FJ128MC706.                            ////
////                                                                 ////
////  This example will work with the PCD compiler.  Change the      ////
////  device, clock and RS232 pins for your hardware if needed.      ////
